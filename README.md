# Passwork_Generator

First, I created variables for each character type. Each character type went into an array.
For the generate password function, I created variables to store the responses to the prompt and confirms.
Then, I created the prompts and confirms for the user to chose the amount of characters and character type.
Then, I created for loops for each character type that would go through the character types and select characters from the index. 
Then, I created a for loop that would randomly select the characters based of the length of the desired password. 
Lastly, I created a conditional that would alert the user if they didn't chose any character types that they have to chose at least one character type.
